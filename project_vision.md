# Project Vision
Through our project, we are trying to explore the theme “Sustainable Development”, under which the three variables we are focussing on are Life expectancy, CO2 emissions and GDP per capita. Using the other variables present in the dataset, we will be finding the correlation between those variables and the three target variables. We will use exploratory data analysis in order to do so and a possible extension to this analysis is to use other statistical models such as linear regression. One could even focus on other target variables as well in order to make a model which is relevant and useful to a greater population. Lastly, the three of us are interested to do research in Demography and hence, we hope the project would be a springboard to our journey.

Through our project, we are trying to explore the theme “Health and Development”, under which the three variables we are focussing on are Life expectancy, BMI (Body Mass Index) and Schooling (no. of years of schooling). Using the other variables present in the dataset, we will be finding the correlation between those variables and the three target variables. We will use exploratory data analysis in order to do so and a possible extension to this analysis is to use other statistical models such as linear regression. One could even focus on other target variables as well in order to make a model which is relevant and useful to a greater population. Lastly, the three of us are interested to do research in the Health and Development field and hence, we hope the project would be a springboard to our journey.
