## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our group is excited to explore the umbrella topic "Sustainable Development". Development has always been and will be the goal of humanity. However, in today's time where the environment is engendered, and as we experience its adverse effects such as climate change, the question arises what can be done to make this development sustainable? Hence, through this exploration, we aim to explore the three main factors of sustainable development. First, money through the target variable GDP. Second, health through the target variable life expectancy. Thirst, the environment through the target variable carbon dioxide emissions. All in all, we are interested in exploring how these three facts are influenced by the various other factors in the dataset. We can imagine generating a very insightful user-facing dashboard as we are exploring very interesting research questions which directly or indirectly impact people's lives. Therefore, we are sure that the dashboard generated would be of high interest to the general public.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset is a population dataset that has the data for several variables for countries all over the world for the last 16 years. The dataset is retrieved from Kaggle and the data itself was provided by two highly-credible websites data.worldbank.org and ourworldindata.org . The data contain variables such as Life expectancy, Population, CO2 emissions, Forest area, GDP per capita, Health expenditure, Military expenditure, and so on for countries all over the world. The data is collected for the years 2000 to 2015 so 16 years in total. The author has made this dataset by combining data from different sources for the purpose of data analytics, public interest, and learning. Users can use this dataset in order to answer their own research questions in which they are interested and can use various data analytics methods to do so. The data was collected from the websites by digitizing historical records.
